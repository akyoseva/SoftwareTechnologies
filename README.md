* The application should allow you to search for a specific product in predefined Web shops (only for regular users).
* The application should send notifications for changes in the price of the subscribed products via push notification and/or email
* A user should be able to subscribe for a single product in the free version of the application.
* A user should be able to pay a monthly subscription to unlock the full functionalities of the application.
